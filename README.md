First thing we see is the email the threat actor has sent to the victim. Pretty standard social engineering tactics here.

I pull up the emailâ€™s source code by going to View, message source.

We can see that the email was sent by yanting@united.com.sg from the IP address 71.19.248.52
I conduct a whois look up on the IP and its from Canada.

The email also contained an attachment named united scientific equipent.exe
Notice the incorrect spelling. I will need to find the file hash of this executable.

I use ANYRUN to search this file and see the details below.
